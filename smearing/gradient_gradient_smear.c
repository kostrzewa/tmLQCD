// Note the difference with Luescher's definition (0907.5491v3 p14):
// The orientation of the plaquette is inverted there and a minus sign is added.
// Since we project to the traceless antihermitian vector space, 
// we can leave out the minus sign.
// This brings it in line with our implementation of stout smearing, coincidentally.

// Note also that we're not updating links one by one.
// This would be impossible to parallelize, but our implementation will differ
// from Luescher's by discretization artifacts of hard to determine size.

// The Runge-Kutta implementation follows (1006.4518v2, p19f).

// Ideally, we'd replace the 'manual' calculation of the staples for a Wilson flow
// by the derivative function for the gauge monomial. This would mean that things
// like the Iwasaki flow are immediately implemented.

// There are currently two issues with this. First, it would require the introduction
// of gauge monomial terms that need not necessarily be part of the action. Second,
// the current implementation of hamiltonian_field_t is simply broken and can't be
// easily called outside of calculations directly related to the action. This is a
// design issue that also affects the smearing implementation and that should, in my
// opinion, be prioritized.

// To facilitate routines that want to incrementally smear, I've added a state tracker
// to the routine and only the difference in t is integrated over. This might actually
// be a useful addition to the other smearing routines as well.
